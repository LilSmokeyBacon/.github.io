						Currently I'm studying at <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/">DAE</a></u>. where im finishing my second year.<br>

					<h1 class="underlined">8080 processor</h1>
					<p>
						Under construction
					</p><br>
					<h3>What is the 8080 processor?</h3>
					<p>The Intel 8080 is an 8-bit microprocessor it was released in 1984 and is the It's successor to the Intel 8008 it has a clock speed of 2 - 4 Mhz with the ability to address up to 64 KB of RAM. 
						I am using this CPU as my first emulator to emulate space invaders, due to it's simplicity and thorough documentation and is thus perfect to get in to emulating bigger and harder things.
					</p><br>
					<img id="Me" src="Images/SpaceInvaders.jpg" alt="Picture of me" style="grid-area: image;" width="50%" height= auto>
					
<!--					<h3>Emulation</h3>
					<p>Opcodes are the heart of any emulator (or cpu). For Chip-8 each opcode is 2 bytes (big-endian) consisting of bits to identify the opcode and bits that contain data.
						For example, "00EE" returns from a subroutine and "2NNN" calls a subroutine at whatever value "NNN" has. The following code is used to identify an opcode and know which function it relates to.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/6899d2ab4c45a2548e3b1fd191e25825.js"></script>
					<p>We can then simply loop over a vector containing our OpcodeDetails and call the appropriate functions like this.</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/d598ca82845093856076134291835bca.js"></script>
					<h3>Sprites</h3>
					<p>Chip-8 has an interesting way of handling sprites and collisions. Drawing a sprite uses opcode "DXYN" which provides us with both the registers for the x and y coordinates and the height of the sprite (n).
						To actually draw the sprite, we read a byte for each row in the sprite (n) at the memory address stored in I (this is a special 16bit register meant to store memory addresses).
						Each bit represents whether or not a pixel is white. The pixel is then xor'ed onto the display, if an older pixel is unset, a collision flag is set for later use.
						This way, we can draw sprites that are 8 pixels wide (1 byte) and n-rows long.
						<br><br>
						In the code snippet underneath, vm.Vx is the virtual machine's array of registers.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/79a53d70f335ec25d0270812d0308af5.js"></script>
					<h3>QT</h3>
					<p>
						The hardest part of setting up QT for this project was figuring out how to render the emulator's viewport.
						I tried opengl but eventually decided that was overkill and settled for the built-in QPainter class. 
						In the end, I made a widget that inherits from QOpenGLWidget and overrides the paintEvent method like this.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/8e797231cbfd3731663d2733a485a22f.js"></script>
					<h3>Cmake</h3>
					<p>
						The cmake for this project ended up being really simple. The CMakeLists for QT is almost entirely managed by QT creator.
						The Chip-8 part is compiled as a stand-alone library like this.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/d2ee11056d7943566f73de4dc21178d2.js"></script>
					<br>
					<p>
						We then tie together the project like this:

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						This was a research project I did about reinforcement learning in 2D shooter games, while this project din't turn out as well as I hoped it would, I did learn a lot from it and really enjoyed it.<br>
						The code in this project isn't the best as it was mainly focused on research. However besides these things I did get some nice results and managed to write a small article about the prosess.

					<h3>Description</h3>

						I really enjoyed the game jam and am planning on joining another one in the future.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Team</h3>
					<p> 
						Our team existed of 2 programmers and 3 artists.
						 We had 4 days to finish the game.
						I mostly did the gameplay programming, including:
					</p><br>
					<ul>
						<li>All the AI</li>
						<li>Picking up and throwing items</li>
						<li>Main game loop</li>
						<li>Hiding and showing walls</li>
						<li>Implementing animations</li>
						<li>Collectables</li>
						<li>Exit door</li>

					<h3>Game Jam</h3>
					<p>
						I made this game with a good friend for the <u>Ludum Dare 42 game jam</u>. This was before I started studying at DAE and even though I knew a decent amount about C++, the good practices were definitely not there.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Mistakes</h3>
					<p>
						There's so much wrong with the codebase that I can't possibly give you focused code snippets.
						Restarting the game was an afterthought I fixed with a goto, causing the biggest memory leak imaginable.
						I knew about constructors, but not about the initializer list and didn't use the destructor. So goodbye RAII principles and hello even more memory leaks!
						The Spaceship's render method wasn't const and has a shocking amount of gameplay logic in there.
						<br>The list goes on, really.<br>
						(You can find the code via our LDJam page, but I won't link to it directly to prevent people from opening it without reading this.)
					</p><br>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>I guess the reason this project is still on my portfolio is simply that it was my first "real" game, we did a pretty good game jam even though our skillset was lacking to say the least.
						<br>It's also an indicator on how far I've come since then and a reminder of why I got into videogames.

					<p>
						I'm doing my graduation work on gameboy sound. The minimum goal is to have an emulator play sound. I'm still looking for a research question and interesting topics to explore later on. 
						It might be interesting to hear how the music sounds when you apply more modern sound processing to the emulator for example.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Relevant topics</h3>
					<p>
						I can reuse what I learned from the chip-8 emulator to know which <u>opcodes</u> to add/implement. I'm also looking into how <u>PCM</u> works and how to play back generated waveforms through <u>SDL</u>.

					<p>
						<u><a target="_blank" href="https://goldarf.itch.io/gameproject-wip-team21">You can follow the progress here!</a></u><br>
						The Ascend is a game where the two main characters Bling and Blong fell down a ravine and on their way out they uncover the mysteries of a long lost tomb.<br>
						Its a game where you have to work togeter to solve puzzles and make your way trough the level, the only catch is that you bound togheter by a rope, luckly you can use this rope to slove the puzzles and get out of the ravine.<br>
 						everything was made in unity and version controlled with <u>perforce</u>.
					</p><br>
					<h3>The team and responsibilities</h3>
					<p>
						We were a team of 1 programmer and 3 artists. Initially, we had 2 programmes but one of them dropped out before during the prototyping phase.<br>
						So essentially all the programming was done by myselfs.
