					<h1 class="underlined">8080 processor</h1>
					<br>
					<p>
						A complete 8080 microprocessor emulator that can run classic space invaders and some COM programs, 
						I mainly chose this emulator to learn more about emulator development and low-level programming.
					<br>
					<br>
					All 255 opcodes have been implemented and tested, also some dedicated shift hardware has been emulated as space invaders use this for moving pixels on the screen and thus adds a hardware shift register to help with the math.
					<br>
					<br>
					As the 8080 is a microprocessor and not a complete machine like a Gameboy, it does not have a standard input or sound, only some ports that can receive and send signals.
					So for sending keyboard signals I used Qt as these are not really part of emulating an 8080. 
					For now there's no sound but emulating a sound card used in old arcade machines might be a fun project for the future.

<!--					<h3>Emulation</h3>
					<p>Opcodes are the heart of any emulator (or cpu). For Chip-8 each opcode is 2 bytes (big-endian) consisting of bits to identify the opcode and bits that contain data.
						For example, "00EE" returns from a subroutine and "2NNN" calls a subroutine at whatever value "NNN" has. The following code is used to identify an opcode and know which function it relates to.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/6899d2ab4c45a2548e3b1fd191e25825.js"></script>
					<p>We can then simply loop over a vector containing our OpcodeDetails and call the appropriate functions like this.</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/d598ca82845093856076134291835bca.js"></script>
					<h3>Sprites</h3>
					<p>Chip-8 has an interesting way of handling sprites and collisions. Drawing a sprite uses opcode "DXYN" which provides us with both the registers for the x and y coordinates and the height of the sprite (n).
						To actually draw the sprite, we read a byte for each row in the sprite (n) at the memory address stored in I (this is a special 16bit register meant to store memory addresses).
						Each bit represents whether or not a pixel is white. The pixel is then xor'ed onto the display, if an older pixel is unset, a collision flag is set for later use.
						This way, we can draw sprites that are 8 pixels wide (1 byte) and n-rows long.
						<br><br>
						In the code snippet underneath, vm.Vx is the virtual machine's array of registers.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/79a53d70f335ec25d0270812d0308af5.js"></script>
					<h3>QT</h3>
					<p>
						The hardest part of setting up QT for this project was figuring out how to render the emulator's viewport.
						I tried opengl but eventually decided that was overkill and settled for the built-in QPainter class. 
						In the end, I made a widget that inherits from QOpenGLWidget and overrides the paintEvent method like this.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/8e797231cbfd3731663d2733a485a22f.js"></script>
					<h3>Cmake</h3>
					<p>
						The cmake for this project ended up being really simple. The CMakeLists for QT is almost entirely managed by QT creator.
						The Chip-8 part is compiled as a stand-alone library like this.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/d2ee11056d7943566f73de4dc21178d2.js"></script>
					<br>
					<p>
						We then tie together the project like this:

					<h1 class="underlined">Reinforcement Learning</h1>
					<br>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						This was a research project I did about reinforcement learning in 2D shooter games, while this project didn't turn out as well as I hoped it would, I did learn a lot from it and really enjoyed it.<br>
						The code in this project isn't the best as it was mainly focused on research. However besides these things I did get some nice results and managed to write a small article about the process.<br>
						<br>
						You can find the full research paper with all the code on my github (see top left for link)<br>
						but here's my conclusion.<br> 
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
						The aim of this paper was to see how well I can use RL to learn a bot basic AI behaviours and how well it would perform in a 2d shooter.
						From my attempt, I can conclude that basic AI behaviours aren't too hard to teach, but teaching an agent how to properly navigate or explore
						a map is a lot harder. I do believe that it is possible, if you have the required knowledge and time for it.
						When you do manage to do it properly, I can see various advantages for using Rl over rule-based systems such as;
						- Minimal code needed for the underlying algorithm in some cases
						- Decrease in the time spent tuning parameters for different situations
						- The ability to produce different bot personality types
						I'd say that teaching an agent how to explore a room was hard for
						my low experience when starting this project - combined with the limited time.
						It might have been better to start off simpler. However, I did learn a lot about machine learning in general
						and I have improved dramatically. So therefore - when I have time - I might restart or continue on this project and try to make something better.
						Further work could be spent on trying different environmental setups with the same agents to see how well they perform in an unknown environment.
						Some of the tasks have already been tested in different environmental setups like the searching for items and shooting an enemy as those setups were random.

						There is a clear future for RL in games, and the potential is limitless.
						When you combine it with more conventional rule-based systems, the options are endless.
						I am genuinely excited to witness the progressions.

					<h1 class="underlined">Raymarching</h1>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This was my first time using unity's compute shader so I started off by making a small test project randomizing the color and position of some cubes,<br>
						I found that it wasn't too diffrent from a class I had in school where we made a raytracer and rasterizer in C++ using DirectX and HLSL,so it was suprisingly easy to get in to.<br>
					After that I felt confident enough to start on making the raymarching project.<br><br>
<!--					I got the idea of making something with raymarching from a video I watched by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague" target="_blank">Sebastian Lague</a> and was happy to find some nice documentation in his video description that helped me along the way.<br>-->
						Making the actual raymarching shader was suprisingly easy, having made a raytracer in the past, it was interesting to see the differences between<br>
						the raytracer and raymarching and seeing whats possible using the signed distance formulas raymarching uses.<br>
						If you're interested you can find and download my project and or read more about it on <a href="https://github.com/Slowlor1ss/Raymarching/" target="_blank">my github</a>.<br>
					</p><br>
					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p> 
						Using signed distance functions allows you to do some operation between shapes like masking, blending, and cutting
						and by combining shapes and using those operation you can create many thing's (some more usefull than others) 
						but regardless of the use case it can be very fun to play around with.

					<h3>Game Jam</h3>
					<p>
						I made this game with a good friend for the <u>Ludum Dare 42 game jam</u>. This was before I started studying at DAE and even though I knew a decent amount about C++, the good practices were definitely not there.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Mistakes</h3>
					<p>
						There's so much wrong with the codebase that I can't possibly give you focused code snippets.
						Restarting the game was an afterthought I fixed with a goto, causing the biggest memory leak imaginable.
						I knew about constructors, but not about the initializer list and didn't use the destructor. So goodbye RAII principles and hello even more memory leaks!
						The Spaceship's render method wasn't const and has a shocking amount of gameplay logic in there.
						<br>The list goes on, really.<br>
						(You can find the code via our LDJam page, but I won't link to it directly to prevent people from opening it without reading this.)
					</p><br>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>I guess the reason this project is still on my portfolio is simply that it was my first "real" game, we did a pretty good game jam even though our skillset was lacking to say the least.
						<br>It's also an indicator on how far I've come since then and a reminder of why I got into videogames.

					<h3>Relevant topics</h3>

						The Ascend is a game where the two main characters Bling and Blong fell down a ravine and on their way out they uncover the mysteries of a long lost tomb.<br>
						It's a game where you have to work together to solve puzzles and make your way trough the level, the only catch is that you bound together by a rope, luckly you can use this rope to slove the puzzles and get out of the ravine.<br>
 						Everything was made in unity and version controlled with <u>perforce</u>.
